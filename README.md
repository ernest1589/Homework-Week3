# Password Generator
## Description
This is a pssword generator that gives you options for you to choose how many characters do you want, and from there you can choos if you want "symbols", "numbers", and if you want "lower" or "upper" case letters
- I built this project as part of a homework to use the tools and knowledge from "week 3" of th Bootcamp
- I learn how many different ways to build a code like this and how youu can combine different methods and specially the challenge of creating the logic of getting to there.

## Usage
This are a couple of screenshots from the code that goes from zero and how then after you choose the option the console shows the result
